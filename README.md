# Currency Converter
## Description
  This is a web based currency converter application. It was one of the projects of my CS425 (Web App Development) class. It is written 
  in Java (Java 8 particularly) and uses java servlet and AJAX for the back-end. The front end which is written in HTML and JavaScript/jQuery consists of a simple form UI via which an user can convert the currency. It consists of two branches namely,
  
  1. **master**
  2. **Database**
  
  In the **master/default** branch, the currency conversion rates are stored in a csv file whereas in the **Database** brach, the currency 
  conversion rates are stored in a database file (Lab4b.sql)
  
  The start page looks like below,
